# Hiring Challenge

## Objective
We need to set up backend APIs that allow authenticated users to search and fetch data from Marvel. You can refer to this [documentation](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) for Marvel APIs. You need to set up a developer account to get an API key.

## Requirements
1. Add a signup API to allow users to create a new profile using name, email, phone number and password. For now, we can skip validating email and phone numbers.
2. Add a login API that allows users to login using phone number & password.
3. Add an authenticated API to return search marvel characters and return character names in a list. Call marvel API to search characters and return matching characters in a list. If no search string is provided, return top 20 characters.

## Bonus points
- Bonus points if code is in typescript
- It is strongly recommended to use ORM layer for database query
- It is recommended to add commands for migration and seeding of database

## Submission Guidelines
- Please add README file with clear instructions on how to setup and run the project
- Push code to a public repository and share link with your hiring manager
